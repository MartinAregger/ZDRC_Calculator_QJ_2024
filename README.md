This repository contains the python code snippet used to calculate Differential reflectivity columns (ZDRC) in the Research Article "Differential reflectivity columns and hail â€“ linking C-band radar-based estimated column characteristics to crowdsourced hail observations in Switzerland" submitted to the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society 

The radar data from the swiss weather radar network is provided by MeteoSwiss in a proprietary format which requires the use of a proprietary library to read them. Due to this, we have converted data for one example timestep into .npy files which you can look at in the "Testfiles_npy" folder. 

The ZDRC computation within the "ZDRC_Caluclation.py" script is functional and there is an example jupyter notebook to show it's use for the given timestep only.
